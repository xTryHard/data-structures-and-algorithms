# Data Structures and Algorithms

Solutions to Data Structure and Algorithms problems from platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, among others.

Resources like the reference to the problem itself and the theory used to solved it will be added.

Each problem's information will be kept in a folder named following the format: _IDOFTHEPROBLEM_NAMEOFTHEPROBLEM_PLATFORM_. For example: 4A_WATERMELON_CODEFORCES.

The file with the reference to the problem, an URL, will be named under the format _idOfTheProblemnameOfTheProblem_platform_reference.txt_
For example: _4a_watermelon_codeforces_reference.txt_

The file with the solution will follow the folder's name convention in lowercase, adding the extension of the used language. In these terms, it will be generally C++, but TypeScript will be added in a while. For example: _4a_watermelon_codeforces.cpp_ or _4a_watermelon_codeforces.ts_

The resources' files will be explicitly named with the topic they are related to. For example: _graphs.txt_, or _binarySearch.txt_. They will contain an explanation of the solution.
